# TherINO: Thermodynamically-Informed Iterative Neural Operators

This paper contains the code and models developed in the paper [Thermodynamically-Informed Iterative Neural Operators for Heterogeneous Elastic Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06529). 

Note that due to size, the trained model weights are uploaded separately on Google Drive hare: TODO.
