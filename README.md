# TherINO: Thermodynamically-Informed Iterative Neural Operators

This paper contains the code and models developed in the paper [Thermodynamically-Informed Iterative Neural Operators for Heterogeneous Elastic Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06529). 

Note that due to size, the trained model weights are uploaded separately on Google Drive here: TODO.

Currently the repository is being cleaned up for publication. All training code and models are frozen, but the internal organization and API will change drastically in the next few weeks.
